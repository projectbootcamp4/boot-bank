# boot-bank

Welcome to the Boot Bank!  A simple banking app using HTML, CSS and Javascript that features a login page and a full dashboard allowing users to track transactions, send money to their contact list, convert money and ask our support staff important questions.  User credentials are stored in the cookies and contacts in local storage.  We used tailwinds CSS to do the media queries.
